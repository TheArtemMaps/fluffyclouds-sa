
##Fluffy Clouds mod for GTA SA
Created by TheArtemMaps (me) thanks to RE3 team for source code of GTA VC and GTA 3. It wouldn't be possible, if it wasn't for them.
This mod adds big clouds from previous GTA games like GTA VC/III.
They react to wind, weather, and use BottomCloudRGB color from timecyc, which means you can color them.
Folder "GTA VC/III TIMECYC" contains timecyc_24h.dat files with settings from previous games, to make clouds look exactly like from GTA VC/III. timecyc24.asi is important, otherwise it won't work. SkyGFX  "https://github.com/aap/skygfx/releases/tag/v4.2b" is needed too, otherwise it will be dark. For some reason.
It's not important, but if you want GTA VC/III look, then install it. timecyc_24h.dat in "data" folder, timecyc24.asi in game root folder.
Enjoy :)
